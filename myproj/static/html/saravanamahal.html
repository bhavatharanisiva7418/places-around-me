                Our Saravana Mahal in Solar can accommodate a seating capacity of 700 and a floating capacity of 1050. 
                The Dining capacity of Saravana Mahal is 300. The Function Hall is on the Ground floor. A parking 
                facility is available for 30 cars and 75 bikes. There is a generator back up for the event to function 
                smoothly during the power cut. The Kalyana Mandapams provides air-conditioned rooms with a locker facility
                 for the guests. Both the Dining hall and Function hall are on the same floor which is an added advantage.
