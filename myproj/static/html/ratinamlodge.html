                I have almost tried up to 7 budget lodges in the 300 to 700 price range/day but so far this one seems to be the best. 
                They charge only Rs.350 per day for a single non-AC room and it was well maintained and clean. I had a special request 
                of getting hot water as early as 4 AM in the morning (scheduled time is 5:30 AM) and to my surprise, the hotel staff 
                knocked my room at 4:02 AM to provide a bucketful of hot water for me. It had Indian toilet but for Rs.350, this deal 
                is a grab. In the ground floor, there is a very decent veg restaurant  which has tasty food at a reasonable 
                price range. Will highly recommend.
